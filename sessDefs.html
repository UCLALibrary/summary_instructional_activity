<p><strong>Session Types</strong></p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>Orientations and Tours: Include group orientations, general tours, and presentations given inside or outside the library in which programs and services are described or physical orientation is given, but instruction (e.g. in the use of resources) is not. Sessions done for UCLA classes are put here only if the content is of this general nature. </li>
<li>Instruction to Classes or Groups: Include in-person instruction for courses and identifiable groups. Include electronic and print instruction here only if it was created for a specific class in lieu of in-person instruction and your expectations for learning were the same as for in-person instruction. Library classes offered on a drop-in or enrollment basis (i.e. not for specific courses) are reported as "Library-Initiated Classes and Demonstrations."</li>
<li>Library-Initiated Classes and Demonstrations: Library instruction programs, including seminars and workshops offered/sponsored/developed by the library not in conjunction with specific courses. Include sessions, e.g. on the UCLA Library Catalog, Next-Generation Melvyl, MELVYL, Web resources, offered by the Library alone or in conjunction with other campus units, e.g., the Graduate Writing Center. In-person, electronic, and print instruction for specific classes or groups are reported as "Instruction to Classes or Groups."</li>
<li>UCLA (Credit) Courses Taught: Include whole courses taught (e.g. LIS 110), regular or Extension. For multi-session classes with a constant enrollment, count every session, but count each person only once (ARL definition). Count as electronic whole courses taught via the Internet. Guest lectures for courses are reported as "Instruction to Classes or Groups."</li>
<li>Small Group Consultations: Include consultations with groups of 2 or more.</li>
<li>Individual Consultations: One-on-one; use only for scholarly communication.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scholarly Communication</strong></p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>Communication with a student, faculty, or staff, on a range of topics associated with intellectual property and publishing, including authors’ rights, copyright, use of copyrighted materials, new scholarly publishing models and open-access initiatives, and the UC eScholarship Repository. Communication may be to an individual or groups and may occur in a variety of locations or formats, for example, in person, in an office or a classroom, or via email, chat, telephone or text.</li>
<li>The SIA Scholarly Communication report includes both individual (one-on-one) and group sessions.</li>
<li>There are two ARL statistical reports that the Library sends forward - - one for instruction and one for reference. According to the ARL definitions, one-on-one activity is always to be counted as reference.
<ul type=circle>
<li>Individual (one-on-one) scholarly communication sessions are tabulated for inclusion in the ARL reference statistics report. </li>
<li>Scholarly communication sessions with a group of two or more persons reported in SIA are tabulated for inclusion in the ARL instructional statistics report. </li>
